I really like the possibility to access to my personnal files from everywhere:
web, laptop, personnal computer, ...
With my Android smartphone, it's a native feature. With my Ubuntu the feature is
recent and there are serious limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mounting google drive with Nautilus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago I was using &lt;a href="https://rclone.org/"&gt;rclone&lt;/a&gt; to access to my google drive 
files. Rclone have really nice 
&lt;a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; feature. But I finally
give up because there is no simple way to automate the login. You always
have difficulties to renew the token.
Here come the nautilus feature that allow you to set oneline account. It's
available from the gnome-control-center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="nautilus_browser" src="https://romainjacquet.github.io/images/oneline_accounts.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="nautilus_config" src="https://romainjacquet.github.io/images/nautilus_oneline.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once configured you can access to your google drive files. But I quicky realized that a lot of 
applications didn't work if the files are located on the drive. Gnumeric, gedit are
working but &lt;a href="https://keepassxc.org/"&gt;keepassxc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vim.org/"&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt; 
doesn't work at all. With keepassxc it sometimes results in data corruption! With vim
the file is correctly displayed but saving the file failed. Even if the &lt;code&gt;nobackup&lt;/code&gt; option,
some strange errors appeared.
&lt;img alt="nautilus_config" src="https://romainjacquet.github.io/images/vim_error.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Under the hood&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nautilus is using a dedicated library named &lt;a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gio/"&gt;gio&lt;/a&gt; that 
provide all the features to
access to remote drives like google. The official gio description tells 
&lt;strong&gt;provide an API that is so good that developers prefer it over raw POSIX calls&lt;/strong&gt;! I was a little bit surprized 
when I read this :-).
The &lt;a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/gio.html"&gt;gio command&lt;/a&gt; allows us 
to manipulate the filesystem from the command line using the gio primitives. Comparing the output
of gio's commands to the standard unix commands (ls, cat) is meaningfull. 
We can understand how gio transform I/O to display the content in nautilus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ls 
17lXzXGnhfA89w39PitPdtblkoOW8t8rA  1HnbYPHAwbchlu1pCMnRS-qxRQtfs4ULO  1LJ9W3ZzmfVMyzE09abGOIswXwdjwI8x2
$ gio list -d
mytext2.txt
kpwd
simpsons
$ gio cat mytext2.txt
toto
titi
tata
tutu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why some applications work and other don't work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the application use the standard POSIX functions like &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; and manipulate files through
plain-old file descriptors it will not work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the application use the gio library and the gio abstractions like &lt;code&gt;GFile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GFileInfo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GInputStream&lt;/code&gt; it will
work. When using &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; directly on the file exposed by gio mount it will break the file because open is not 
aware that it is a network share. And some attributes like 'standard::display-name' are lost when performing IOs.
&lt;strong&gt;From Nautilus, if you open a file with an application that don't use gio you could corrupt or lost the file&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;the future?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't imagine that all applications will use gio in the future. Gio is intended for Gnome application not for
all the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to have a native support for Google Drive in the future? I mean that you can access without any
additionnal library like gio or KIO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible for gio to intercept POSIX calls and transform them into GIO call?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure because this is complex. But it could be a better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Desktop chair of 2006 VS gaming chair of 2020</title><link href="https://romainjacquet.github.io/desktop-chair-of-2006-vs-gaming-chair-of-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-01T14:48:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-05-01T14:48:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Romain JACQUET</name></author><id>tag:romainjacquet.github.io,2020-05-01:/desktop-chair-of-2006-vs-gaming-chair-of-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;dxracer formula08 review&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just after the beginning of the lockdown in France, I started homeworking full time.
I quickly realized that my old computer chair of 2005 was not good enough
to sit from eigth to ten hours per day in front of my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bougth this chair sixteen years ago when I was a student. It was
fine for years but currently: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the foam of the seat is near to zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sometime feel some pressure on the elbows. Because armrests are made
with a narrow piece of hard plastic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no neck support because the chair back stop after the shoulder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2005 desktop chair" src="https://romainjacquet.github.io/images/old_chair_2005.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordering new chair with the lockdown was not really easy because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delivery is a little bit chaotic and delay could be longer than
two weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buying a chair online is not really easy. Finding the correct
size is not simple and I spent a lot of time to look at sizing chart of
the different supplyer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose a DxRacer Formula 08 and I was lucky to receive it two days after
 ordering!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2005 desktop chair" src="https://romainjacquet.github.io/images/2020_gaming_chair.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of usage, here is the summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the wide and soft armrests are really confortable. The armrest are fully covered 
by a very soft material. I really like it; and now I consider that the 
armrest of my old chair were horrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the armrest are said &lt;code&gt;3D&lt;/code&gt;. You can adjust the heigth, the angle and the distance
from the back. It is really cool, but I wish I could pull them backward with two or three
additionnal centimeters. I like to work very close from the desktop. Maybe I got shorter arms
than the average :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the neck support and neck pillow are helpfull. Where I read a doc or watch a video,
you can fully lean against the chair back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my gaming chair have a lumbar pillow and I sometimes felt a litte tension in the lumbar
at the end of the day. I had the feeling that the lumbar pillow was too big for me.
Either my back is flatter than the average or my weigth is to low for this pillar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the major difference between a gaming chair and a traditionnal desktop chair is the angle between
the seat and the floor. With gaming chairs the seat is not really flat, there is a small angle. Exactly
like if you were sitting in a sport car, you lean backward. With this position, it's more difficult
 to spread the legs behind the desk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="angle comparaison" src="https://romainjacquet.github.io/images/seat_angle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy with my new chair. The only problem is the lumbar pillow.
I finally discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/am8jmp/dxracer_chair_lumbar_pillow_is_it_okay_not_to_use/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; 
describing the same feeling with the lumbar pillow.
I will probably customize it by removing extra foam inside. There is a zipper and
the foam is easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
